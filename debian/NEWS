netsed (1.00b-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This package is now based on the efforts of a new
  upstream author, having forked the stale original,
  and having continued the development from that point.

  This makes the shipped manual page outdated, since I
  myself am aiding upstream in writing the new documenta-
  tion. It will enter only with the next upstream release.
